# Motivation
This Assignment is focused around learning how to collobarate in a team and get real world experience of implementing different algorithms together and using
different technologies to leverage growth and success. In this Project we are implementing the Bankers Algorithm by writing a multiple threaded programs which implements the algorithm. Our motivation comes from looking at how the algorithm actually works and how we can implement this in a Linux Environment. Furthermore it has given us the opportunity to learn more about the use of GitHub which is not taught in classroom and will provide us with necessary work experience.

# Installation
Linux Operating system is required for this program to run. 
IDE of choice can be used to run the code.
We chose to use eclipse as our choice of IDE due to its simple integration with GitHUb.

# Individual contribution (Function-wise)

# Features
User will have the ability to keep track of the resources. 

Users will be able to grant a request if it satisfies the safety algorithm.

If a request does not leave the system in a safe state, the user can deny it.

Safety algorithm is also used to allow for request to be examined and then denyed
